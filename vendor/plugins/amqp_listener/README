== AMQP Listener
a.k.a "Floppy Ears" (since everything that connects to RabbitMQ apparently has to have a cute lapine nickname)

So this plugin is just like ActiveMessaging or Workling, except that it's specific to sending and handling AMQP messages, and being so specific it's much simpler.  It's basically a light wrapper around http://github.com/tmm1/amqp to integrate like Workling/ActiveMessaging into your rails app.  Meaning it gives you a script you can run alongside your rails app to handle messages, a folder to define all those message handlers in, and a yaml config file to define your AMQP connections.

=== Setup
When we have a generator, it will make amqp_listeners folder in app, and amqp_listener.yml file in config and an amqp_listener script in script

for now you can just use: AmqpListener.run and let the exceptions lead you into the rest
